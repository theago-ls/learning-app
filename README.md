This repository contains a React Native app project. Following the test requirements, I stopped working on it after two hours. I could not do much, but I will exposure some of my thoughts about the app below.

# Tools

- TypeScript;
- ESLint;
- Prettier;
- React Native Testing Library.

# What would be my next steps

- Add a library for handling requests - e.g. Axios;
- Add an state management library - I would choose React Query, but Redux is a good choice too;
- Add animations, which are crucial for an app like this. Moti makes possible to create great animations in a simple syntax but Reanimated 2 could be needed for more complex animations.

# Observations

- I don't have much experience working with Firebase, so I decided to focus on the React Native side;
- I prefer to use React Native Testing Library instead of just Jest because I think that behavior testing is the best approach to test React applications. UI details can be tested with E2E tests, e.g. Detox;
